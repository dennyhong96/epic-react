    // You're going to re-implement this code using React!
    // 💣 So go ahead and delete this implementation (or comment it out for now)
    // These three lines are similar to React.createElement

    // React is in charge of creating react elements
    const element = React.createElement('div', {className: 'container'}, [
      React.createElement('span', {key: '1'}, 'Hello'),
      ' ',
      React.createElement('span', {key: '2'}, 'World'),
    ])

    // ReactDOM is in charge of taking react elements and put them onto the page
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'))

    // 🐨 Please re-implement the regular document.createElement code above
    // with these React API calls
    // 💰 The example in the markdown file should be a good hint for you.
